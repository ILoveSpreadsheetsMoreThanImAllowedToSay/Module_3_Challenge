1. Project's Title
  Basic Financial and Poll Data Analysis 

2. Project Description
  This python script accepts the financial data for a theoretical company and the polling data for a theoretical small town election.
  For the financial data, a table is generated containing some basic information about profit gains and losses.
  For the poll data, a table is generated showing the performance and winning candidates.
  Both scripts will produce a .txt file with the same information that shows up in the terminal.

4. How to Install and Run the Project
  Download the python-challenge directory locally and execute either or both main.py files using a python interpretter for PyBank and PyPoll for the financial analysis and polling data, respectively.

6. How to Use the Project
  The data format expected is:
  PyBank - a pair of columns: the first contining date information in mmm-YY format, and aggregate profit/loss information in the other.
  PyPoll - a set of three columns' data: Ballot ID as a string, County as string, and Candidate as string.
  
  Download the python-challenge directory and maintain the folder structure of python-challenge/PyPoll or /PyBank, each with a Resources and Analysis folder.
  Open and execute the python files, main.py, in each of the PyPoll/PyBank root folders.
  
  Data will be output to the terminal as well as a .txt file, housed in the Analysis folder.
